This is a set of windows command scripts that was for Windiows XP. 

They were intented for periodically playing back a short set of affirmations throughout the night. It comes with a prerecorded default set of affirmations, but it has a features for launching the Windows sound recorder to record your own.

The set of affirmations is recorded in a .wav file. The scripts set the affirmations sessions to be run every hour for 6 hours. In each session, the.wav file to be repeated 21 times.

The the play script relies on a Windows executable for playing .wav files via the command line called WAV.EXE; which comes with it's own license. The license can be found at https://github.com/brbrewster/rsaffirm-xp/blob/master/rsaffirm/lib/WAV.TXT
